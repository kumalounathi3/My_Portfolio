          <h2>A snipet about me!</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            I'm compassionate, adventurous and sometimes like cooking. When i
            first saw coding i thought to myself that i would never do it, until
            i tried learning and coded myself my perspective changed i realized
            that codeing is fun and I can do it too. As I got to learn more
            thats when I studied IT with Varsity College and now I'm a graduate.
            Moral of the story is Try it before you deny it. Your capablities
            are unlimited, we created to do more than what we think we can.

            I took part in the Geekulcha DataThon bootcamp, The NEMISA Data
            Science Hackathon challenges participants to engage with government
            data to unlock insights that could inform policy decisions. The
            hackathon is a collaborative multi-stakeholder partnership between
            provincial governments, institutions of higher learning, youth
            formations, digital technology experts and mentors in partnership
            with data science enthusiasts. I had a great experience and learned
            alot and took on alot of information.

            Learning is the process of gaining new skills, knowledge,
            understanding, and values. This is something people can do by
            themselves, although itâ€™s generally made easier with education: the
            process of helping someone or a group of others to learn. With
            educational support, learning can happen more efficiently. Education
            is also how we collect and share all the skills and knowledge we
            learn individually. Benefitting from education instead of having to
            build new skills and knowledge by ourselves from scratch is part of
            what it means to live in a society instead of in isolation.
